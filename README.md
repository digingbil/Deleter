# Deleter
Simple, yet powerful PHP file deletion script.

Ho to use it:
-------------

1.  Place it in your desired folder. Let’s say:
    
    /user/public\_html/my\_site/Deleter.php
    
2.  And run it through the browser like
    
    https://mysite.com/Deleter.php
    
3.  Wait to finish loading and you’re done. The script will also “self-delete” as part of the process. So no security leftovers will be present on your site.

### Disclaimer:

Since this is a very powerful script it is important to be 100% sure where are you putting it and which files and folders you really like to delete before you even run it. When the script finishes, the deleted files are lost forever! So be careful what you are doing and use it at your own risk. I shall not be held liable for any misuse or damages it may do to your data or server.
